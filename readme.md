## About InstaClone

InstaClone is a duplicate website of www.instagram.com built using Laravel & Bootstrap Framework, SASS, PhP, JQuery, Vue.js & SQLite. The code flow for home page and profile page is a duplicate from instagram. However, instagram do not have a upload image page and for this instaclone, I created my own customize upload image page. This website also have an existing secure database for users and images using SQLite.
